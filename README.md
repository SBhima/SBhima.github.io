# Portfolio Website

This is the repo for everything you see on my personal website.

All of the 3D modeling was done using React 3 Fiber and Drei. Here are some of the links that I used to get started.

**The base model for the solar system**: https://medium.com/geekculture/build-3d-apps-with-react-animated-solar-system-part-1-c4c394a8574c

**The animation system**: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/bounds-and-makedefault-rz2g0?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js


All of the planet textures were from Adobe Stock Images...the abstract colorful wallpapers found online look an awful lot like planets...
